# Dorsal-Hand-Vein-Based-Cancellable-Biometric-Authentication-System

### Privacy Enhancing Revocable Biometric Identities (PERBI), 2016-19 –AwardedbyBoard of Research in Nuclear Sciences(BRNS), Department of Atomic Energy, Govt of India(Funding Rs. 28.8 lacks). (Status: On-going)

I contributed to the above live projects under the supervision of Dr. Pritee Khanna(Principal Investigator) at Indian Institute of Information technology, and built a Multimodal Biometric System with Recocable Capabilities, and Implemented a dorsal hand vein authentication system from scratch.

Major Contribution:

1. During Processing Dorsal Hand Image, developed a heuristic blurring method to remove hair from the image.

2. Extracted clear vein pattern from the dorsal Image by Implementing Maximum Curvature Method.

3. Implemented a Cancellable capability to address the Stolen token(user information) scenario.

4. Reduce the dimension of data up to 75% and achieved 94% multi-class classification accuracy•

In this project, I had to build a biometric authentication system, and need to perform authentication based on a person's vein pattern. Since veins are present inside the body, in most cases, not visible to the naked eye so this system was more secure than others.


> My projects mainly consisted of five steps which are as follows,
* Data Collection, Dorsal Hand Image Acquisition.
* Data processing.
* Feature extraction.
* Feature protection.
* Classification.
 

**About Data**

I used 850 dorsal hand images, taken from a special device that use Infrared light to capture viens data.
850 Biometric Data = 85 person, 10 samples each.

How data capture device work: Unlikely to oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxidized hemoglobin absorbs light at a wavelength of about 760nm, which is in the range of the near-infrared (NIR) band. Therefore, when the dorsal hand is illuminated with near-infrared light, deoxidized hemoglobin absorbs the light and appears as a black pattern in the dorsal image.
