        "# 1. Introduction\n",
        "Biometrics is an excellent system for security, which is used in various platforms such as industry, banking, mobile phones, presence, etc. Currently, various methods of biometric systems are used such as fingerprints, iris scans, voice recognition, retinal scans, face recognition, etc. being an excellent method for unique identification as well as the risk of compromising it Produces. Biometrics systems like fingerprints can be easily hacked by copying your fingerprints from a glass panel, or other places, and this system can be hacked repeatedly using easy techniques like Sticky Bear fingerprints. Therefore, we are trying to develop a biometric authentication system based on the idea of ​​\"cancelable biometrics\" using template security approaches, which are revokable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### A. Biometric System\n",
        "Biometric authentication is a process that relies on a person's specific biological characteristics to verify his or her identity. In biometric authentication, a person's biometric information is captured and matched to the biometric already stored in the database. If both data (captured and stored) match, authentication is confirmed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Biometric authentication is the most effective and secure authentication system, because a person's biological information is unique, and it is also difficult to transfer from one person to another. It is possible that a person's password and unique ID can be stolen and leaked but biological information is always safe, and cannot be leaked and stolen.\n",
        "\n",
        "### B. Cancellable Biometrics\n",
        "Since biometric authentication is widely used in the authentication systems in various departments, and biometric information is stored digitally in databases. So there is a possibility that anyone can attack the database and steal user's biological information. , And use them for unfair means. To avoid such attacks and secure our data, we will use the Cancellabale biometric authentication system. In a revocable biometric system, we intentionally repeatedly distort biometric characteristics to protect the user's biological information.\n",
        "\n",
        "A template is used to distort the feature by which the main feature is converted into some other information. After using this revocable biometric, when an attacker tries to steal data, the attacker will only get a piece of malformed information from the database and the original data information will be protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "### C. Research Gap and Motivation\n",
        "After analyzing the literature reviews, we came to know the following research gaps and motivations, which are listed below.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The dorsal veins are novel biometric features, they are very safe compared to thumbprints, and other biometric features, and are very difficult to fool. The characteristic of the dorsal vein also tells us about the livelihood of the person.  As the device captures the image of the dorsal vein using infrared light, compared to oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxidized hemoglobin absorbs light at a wavelength of about 760nm, which is in the range of the near-infrared (NIR) band. Therefore, when the dorsal hand is illuminated with near-infrared light, deoxidized hemoglobin absorbs light and appears as a dark pattern in the dorsal image. If a person is not alive, the blood will not oxidize, and the vein pattern will not be captured.\n",
        "\n",
        "- We have seen in the literature review, the dorsal vein authentication started in 2010, which is a very new technology for authentication, and biometric authentication systems have not contributed much to this area.\n",
        "\n",
        "- From the literature, we have seen that there is a security technology called \"cancellable feature\" that provides a batter and safe biometric system.\n",
        "\n",
        "This forms our motivation for biometric identification of dorsal veins for efficient feature extraction, as well as its template preservation using cancellable geometric technology.\n",
        "\n",
        "### D. Contribution\n",
        "Four important contributions have been made to this work, which is described as follows.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The current cancelable biometric technique was studied and implemented by Harkirat Kaur and Preeti Khanna (2017). I applied this paper to Python and explored aspects of practical implementation, to understand the concept and work of a cancelable biometric system.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Extract the feature from the Dorsal Hand Vein. To improve the image content of the dorsal vein, preprocessing is required, because, in the normal dorsal vein image, many redundant features can reduce the quality of the required features. Since the presence of hair on the hands is a drawback for the features extraction technique. To improve the quality of the dorsal vein we specified a technique for hair extraction using a *Mexican Hat Filter*. Also, I applied the technique of maximum curvature method from a paper, for efficient dorsal vein extraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Provide template protection to dorsal vein features using an XOR-based revocable biometric template transformation scheme.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Applied the Colonel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFA) for classification."
