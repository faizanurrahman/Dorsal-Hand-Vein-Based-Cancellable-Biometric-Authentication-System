	1. we create a binary array by threshold the original array.
	2. We create a new array, which is moved by a pixel in the right
		direction of the threshold array.
	3. Subtract the new array from the threshold array and get another new array.
	4. When the value of the subtracted array is positive, it means that it is the beginning of curvature,
		and when the value of the array is negative it means that it is the end of curvature,
		we store all the starting and ending pairs. And the width of the curvature is measured
		by the length of the start end pair, and the depth of curvature is measured by the
		maximum value present at the location of the start end pairs in the original array.
		Finally, the location of the center is set by the midpoint of width.
