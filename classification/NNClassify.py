#
# GENERAL DESCRIPTION
# The function performs matching score calculation based on the input data
# and returns a structure that among other fields also contains a
# similarity matrix that can be used to compute ROC curves, CMC curves and
# other statistics such as equal erro rates, rank one recognition rates and
# others. The function takes either four, five, six or seven input
# arguments. For a detailed description of the input arguments have a look
# at the section below.
#
# The function is capable of producing complete similarity matrices, where
# each of the feature vectors from the training/target/gallery feature
# vector matrix is matched again each of the feature vector in the
# test/query/evaluation feature vector matrix, or two separate similarity
# matrices with only client/genuine and only impsotor matching scores.
#
# Note that this function is intended to be used for baseline comparisons,
# you can implement the matching and classification steps yourselves and
# use the remaining tools from this toolbox to evaluate your results.
#
# To see an example of usage of the function look at the examples above or
# find an appropriate demo in the demo folder.

#
#
# INPUTS:
# train                 - training/target/gallery feature-vector matrix of
#                         size BxA, where each of the A columns represents
#                         a feature vector (or sample) each having a
#                         dimensionality of B (i.e., each feature vector
#                         contains B features) - obligatory argument
# train_ids             - a vector of size 1xA (or Ax1), where each numeric
#                         value in "train_ids" encodes the class memebership
#                         of the corresponding sample in "train" -
#                         obligatory argument
# test                 -  test/query/evaluation feature-vector matrix of
#                         size CxD, where each of the D columns represents
#                         a feature vector (or sample) each having a
#                         dimensionality of C (i.e., each feature vector
#                         contains C features) - obligatory argument
# test_ids              - a vector of size 1xC (or Cx1), where each numeric
#                         value in "test_ids" encodes the class memebership
#                         of the corresponding sample in "test" -
#                         obligatory argument
# n                     - a scalar value specifying the number of features
#                         to be used in the matching process; if this
#                         argument is omitted a default value of
#                         "size(train,1)" is used (optional argument)
# dist                  - a string identitifer determining the type
#                         distance measure to use:
#                           dist = 'cos'(default) | 'euc' | 'ctb' | 'mahcos'
# match_kind            - a string identifier determining the
#                         classification logic to use; valid options are:
#                           match_kind = 'all' (default) | 'sep'
#                         Here, the 'all' option causes that comparisons
#                         between all feature vectors from the
#                         training/gallery/target and test/query/evaluation
#                         matrices are conducted and that the
#                         corresponding matching scores are generated. Thus
#                         the final similarity matrix looks something like
#                         this:
#
#                               [q1][q2][q3] ... [qC]
#                           [g1]  x   x   x  ...   x
#                           [g2]  x   x   x  ...   x
#                           [g3]  x   x   x  ...   x
#                            ... ... ... ... ...  ...
#                           [gA]  x   x   x  ...   x
#
#                         In the case, where the 'sep' option is used, two
#                         similarity matrices are computed, which actually
#                         represent two sub-matrices pulled from the
#                         similarity matrix generated with the 'all' option.
#                         The first similarity matrix is the client
#                         similarity matrix, which is computed only for
#                         the images of those subjects that are both in the
#                         training/gallery/target and test/query/evaluation
#                         feature vector matrices. The second similarity is
#                         the impostor similarity matrix, which is computed
#                         only for the images of those subjects from the
#                         test feature vector matrix that are not also in the
#                         training/gallery/target feature vector matrix.
#
